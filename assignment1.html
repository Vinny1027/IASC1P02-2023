	<h1><strong>Who I am</strong></h1>

	<body>

		<div>
			<p> Hi, I'm <strong><em>Carl Ferma</em></strong>, I am 17 years old.
				I like chicken nuggets and green tea boba. I enjoy making comic books,
				I also love to draw. Drawing is something I love to do in my pasttime,
				when i need to destress, etc. I want to work in the film industry when
				I graduate but I do understand how corrupt they can be when it comes to money.
				I've been in a short film called <em>Brave Hearts</em>, it's about a star student and
				athlete who gains a gaming addiction and has to overcome it with the help of
				religon, friends and family. I was the main star of the movie named <em>"Malakai Buenafe"</em>.
				I go <strong><em>Brock Univerity</em></strong>, I am taking IASC which is really fun but I genuinely did not expect to be
				coding and doing these things but I do enjoy it.</p>

	<h1><strong>What forms of art have I done</strong></h1>

		<div>
			<p> I've worked on many things, and a lot of them I'm more than proud of. First, in grade 11,
				I created my first comic book as an art project. My comic book is called <strong><em>"Reo The Blood Manipulator"</em></strong>,
				it's about a high schooler who gains the ability to manipulate blood and has to go on a journey to hone those powers
				and fight villians. That comic book was my first but it lacked a lot of plot and visual details. I learnt from that so
				currently, I am creating another comic book called <strong><em>"Cold Roses"</em></strong>. I wanted to focus about men's pain and silent suffering,
				so the story is about a father who has to grieve the recent death of her wife while trying to surpress his emotions and be there
				for his 5 year old daughter. One day he finds out that his wife worked for an organization that is trying to take down the corrupt
				government from taking over the world. I've also created artwork in grade 12, those pieces of artwork has been in the DSBN Grad Show.</p>
