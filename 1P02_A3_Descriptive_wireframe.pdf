Descriptive Wireframe - A3 1P02


	The website I chose to redesign is a site called Mandela Tech
	(https://www.mandelatech.com). The reason I chose to use this website
	is because of its unsettling flaws; a big reason this website is flawed is due to the colour arrangement. On my screen, the background is black and so is the text in the website, it uses comic sans, it has an odd placement of where the text is, it can be hard to figure out the store hours because it’s hiding near the bottom of the page, the “official website” in the page header is very squished and it shouldn’t belong there, “what happened to Mandela Tech?” is very out of place and doesn’t belong.

I decided to change all of it, even the colour choice of the page. I decided to
take out the “official website” in the page header because having that will seem
like it’s trying to look like an official site but gives viewers the wrong idea.
I’m changing the font in the page header to make it look more techy, and the text
font because no one likes comic sans. I decided to change the colour scheme of the
website to a monochromatic blue theme because even though green is techy, blue gives
 people a sense of calmness psychologically and would make people less unsettled.
 The layout of media in the original site seems very right side heavy, so I’m putting
  it in the centre for it to be a focal point. Colour theory applies to the new design
	because even though it is just blue, it has different shades and tones which gives
	the site a variety of colour and style, there are also  different contrasts within the
	hue while the original just has a similar colour to the same colour of green.
	Design wise, the layout in the redesign is more centre focused while the old one
	is heavy on the right side. I put the hours near the top of the page so it’s easy
	to locate and the site summary doesn’t take up unnecessary space on the site.
