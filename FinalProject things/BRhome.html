		<div class = "backstory">On the outskirts of the quaint town of Ravenswood, there lies an enigmatic estate known as "Ebony Manor."
			This elegant Victorian mansion, shrouded in an air of mystery, has a rich history that stretches back through
			generations. Originally constructed in the late 19th century by the eccentric philanthropist and botanist,
			Victor Blackthorn, the manor was intended to serve as a haven for the arts and sciences.<br />

				Victor Blackthorn, a reclusive figure, was known for his passion for exotic plants. The sprawling gardens surrounding Ebony Manor
			were his pride and joy, featuring an impressive collection of rare and vibrant flora from around the world.
			Scholars and artists were invited to the estate, fostering an atmosphere of creativity and intellectual pursuit.<br />

				The manor's opulent halls once echoed with the laughter of esteemed guests engaged in spirited discussions on art,
			literature, and the wonders of nature. Many a night, the grand ballroom saw lively dances and musical performances
			that captivated the hearts of those fortunate enough to attend.<br />

				Over time, however, the estate fell into disrepair as Victor Blackthorn's health declined. The gardens, once meticulously tended, began to grow wild, and the
			once-vibrant manor became a shadow of its former glory. Eventually, the manor passed into the hands of distant
			relatives who had little interest in maintaining its legacy. <br />

				Now, in the present day, Ebony Manor stands as a
			forgotten relic, awaiting rediscovery. The once-elegant estate, with its overgrown gardens and faded grandeur,
			holds the key to a hidden history. As the doors of Ebony Manor creak open once more, the echoes of its past whisper
			tales of beauty, intellect, and a bygone era. The manor's mysteries are about to be unveiled, inviting those curious
			enough to step into its halls and explore the untold stories within.<br />
